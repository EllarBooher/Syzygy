#
# Justification for removals:
#
# llvm-header-guard
# #pragma once works well enough since headers are unique
#
# misc-include-cleaner
# IWYU is set up for the project, so this is redundant.
#
# misc-misplaced-const
# Too noisy, since Vulkan contains many typedef'd pointers i.e. VkDevice is VkDevice_T*
#
# readability-named-parameter
# Not naming a parameter expresses that the type name is enough.
#
# readability-identifier-length
# Does not seem to impact readability all that much.
#
# bugprone-unchecked-optional-access
# Sometimes causes crashes and has false positives in clang-tidy verison 17
#
# bugprone-exception-escape
# Fires false positives with clang-tidy version 17, on structs with certain types.
# Seems to be an issue with std::string or std::variant on Windows, but I have not investigated deeply
