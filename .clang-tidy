# Justification for removals:
#
# misc-include-cleaner
# IWYU is set up for the project, so this is redundant.
#
# misc-misplaced-const
# Too noisy, since Vulkan contains many typedef'd pointers i.e. VkDevice is VkDevice_T*
#
# readability-identifier-length
# Does not seem to impact readability all that much.
#
# bugprone-unchecked-optional-access
# Sometimes causes crashes and has false positives in clang-tidy verison 17
